# Identifying Concrete Cracks with Image Classification using Neural Network
# 1. Summary 
The aim of the project is identify cracks on concrete images using convolutional neural network. This project is a computer vision task where it is a binary classification problem. The model is trained with a dataset of 400000 images where 200000 images is divided equally between positive (cracks) and negative (no cracks) classes. The source of the dataset can be found https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5y9wdsg2zt/2
# 2. IDE and Framework
This project is completed mainly using Spyder IDE. The main frameworks used in this project are Numpy, Matplotlib and TensorFlow Keras.
# 3. Methodology
The methodology for this project is inspired by a documentation on the official TensorFlow website. The documentation can be refer https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning
